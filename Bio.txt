Greetings IGN,

I’m Michael Arevalo, a San Diego native from… San Diego. 
I am currently a San Diego State University student studying 
Computer Science. I have two semesters left before I graduate 
and try to bust in the gaming industry as a programmer. 
I am applying to the Code Foo program in order to gain experience
in the industry before I venture out to officially become part of
it.  

I have taken courses in coding C, C++, C#, Java, Assembly Language 
(M6800), and Fortran. I also have experience in working with Epic's
Unreal Engine as well as Valve's Source Engine. 

I like cake.

I am a huge gamer! I own pretty much any and every game that’s worth 
owning in accordance to your websites recommendations. IGN has been
my go to source for game info and reviews ever since that faithful day in 2006
when I bought an Xbox 360 and Sonic The Hedgehog (BLAH!). You fellows have
not failed me since. 

I look forward to hopefully working with you fine folks,

Michael Arevalo
